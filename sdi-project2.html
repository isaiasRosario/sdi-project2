<p>My mom gave me $10 for lunch this week. I have to pay $2 for lunch each day and I go to
Monday through Friday. I have to figure out home much money I will have left each day of the week.
So if each day I have to pay $2 for lunch then that means I will have to do some subtraction. If my
mom gave me $10 and its only $2 a day for lunch 5 days  week then I should use up all my money in one 
week. I will work on some javascript programming to show how it works out. </p>
